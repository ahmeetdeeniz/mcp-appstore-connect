 * data it reads as a zero. Both are wrong often enough to matter, because the
 * *same* 404 covers a third case: a period Apple has not assembled yet.
 *
 * Weekly and monthly reports are built after the dailies, so a week that just
 * ended can 404 while every day inside it has sales — and "no sales" versus "not
 * computed yet" are opposite conclusions about the same response. The caller
 * cannot tell them apart from the status code, so the message names the check
 * that can.
 *
 * That check differs by report, which is why the remedy is a parameter. Sales
 * reports can be re-asked at a finer granularity; finance reports have no
 * granularity at all, so telling their caller to "re-ask at DAILY" names an
 * argument that tool does not have.
