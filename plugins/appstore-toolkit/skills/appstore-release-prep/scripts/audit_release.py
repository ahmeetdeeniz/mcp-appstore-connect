"""Pre-flight audit for an App Store release.

Answers the questions you cannot reliably eyeball:
  - What version are we shipping, and where is the boundary of the last release?
  - Which commits land in this release, and which shipped in the LAST one but
    were never announced?
  - Does every App Store Connect field, in every locale, fit inside Apple's
    character limits?
  - Which fields have been edited since the last export, and therefore need pushing?
  - Where is the store copy still carrying em dashes?
  - Has the screenshot config drifted from the copy that documents it?
  - What does each cross-platform (family) image claim, so it can be checked
    against the description?
  - What does each app preview or promo video claim, and was it rendered before
    the captures it is cut from?

# first version, so audit() drops it from this set for a 1.0.

# "First" is per PLATFORM, and the CHANGELOG cannot see that. One repo ships a
# Mac and an iOS build from one target and one CHANGELOG, so the first iOS
# version can be 1.8.1 with fourteen entries above it: `last_released` is set,
# WHAT'S NEW is demanded, and the gate fails on copy Apple will not accept.
# Nothing offline distinguishes that case -- the sidecar records the platform

    person to check against the description, and whether the local render is older
    than the captures it was cut from.

    A video built `--from-stills` reuses the screenshot captures, so a UI change that
    makes the screenshots stale makes it stale too, and nothing on the store says so:
    a preview is a separate upload, outside anything this audit can see. Its hook and
    captions are short claims, like a family caption, and get the same treatment:
    listed, never judged. Accent marks (`*word*`) are stripped, since they are styling.

    Staleness is read from file times next to the config: the newest render report
    under `videos/report/` against the newest capture under `source/` of each screen
    the video shows. Both directories are local and usually gitignored, so a fresh
    clone has neither, which is reported as "not rendered here", not as stale. A
    video with `cue` beats is recorded from the running app rather than cut from
    stills, so its captures are not compared.
